This file records promotion state only. It does not contain credentials, task
payloads, API responses, billing data, or private paths.

## Positioning

**Codex Third-Party Workers** lets Codex delegate bounded text, code, research,
and local-validation tasks to reviewed third-party or Chinese model APIs while
the main Codex thread remains on OpenAI and performs final review.

It is not a Codex replacement, an OpenAI product, a universal compatibility
layer, or a promise of a fixed cost reduction.

## Tracking convention

GitHub-to-GitHub promotion links use the canonical repository URL without UTM
parameters because this repository has no separate analytics-enabled homepage.
If a canonical website is added later, use:

```text
utm_source=<community-or-repository>
utm_medium=github
utm_campaign=codex-third-party-workers
utm_content=<asset-or-post>
```

## Prepared external assets

- OpenAI Codex `Show and tell` draft:
  `docs/promotion/openai-codex-show-and-tell.md`
- Awesome List fit audit and proposed data entry:
  `docs/promotion/awesome-list-candidates.md`
- Release notes draft:
  `docs/promotion/release-notes-v0.4.0-beta.1.md`

Every external action remains **USER ACTION REQUIRED** until the user explicitly
authorizes that specific publication.
