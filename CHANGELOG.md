All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

- Rename the public project to **Codex Third-Party Subagents** / **Codex 第三方
  子代理** and the repository/package slug to `codex-third-party-subagents`.
  Retain the existing `codex-third-party-workers` on-disk runtime namespace for
  upgrade and uninstall compatibility.
- Migrate Host identity to official Codex Custom Agent TOML definitions:
  `name` is authoritative; routing remains a separate policy guardrail.
- Add explicit-only `deepseek_pro_worker -> deepseek-v4-pro` configuration,
  plus migration-safe installer, read-only Doctor capability/identity checks,
  per-agent verify evidence, duplicate conflict handling, and rollback tests.
  V4 Pro is never automatically selected.
- Correct the old programmatic Pro rejection classification: it was a project
  policy result, not a Host identity registration limitation.
- Fix the macOS default bridge-root resolution used by the bridge CLI when no
  platform override is supplied, with regression coverage.
- Record a bounded DeepSeek V4 Flash maintainer E2E: explicit worker execution,
  non-sensitive fixture diagnosis, bridge completion/release, and main-thread
  review. The verifier remains `runtimeVerified: false`; this does not add an
  automatic routing or general public-installer claim.
- Record a fresh-session, attributable `deepseek_pro_worker` maintainer E2E on
  Codex CLI `0.147.0`: the expected DeepSeek provider/model handled the same
  read-only coding fixture, reproduced its failures, identified the exact fix,
  used tools, completed and released the bridge, and was main-thread reviewed.
  This explicit-only path does not establish automatic routing, broad
  public-installer success, independent user acceptance, or
  `runtimeVerified: true`.
- Record a direct DeepSeek V4 Pro programmatic-subagent audit on Codex CLI
  `0.147.0`. The then-current project policy exposed only the Flash role, so
  the named Pro probe was rejected before a provider request. This historical
  result is not a Host identity registration conclusion.
- Add community documentation index and demos to improve first-contact user onboarding.
  Includes `docs/demos/qwen-worker-demo.md`, `docs/demos/minimax-worker-demo.md`,
  `docs/demos/deepseek-worker-demo.md`, and `docs/demos/README.md`.
- Add bilingual onboarding-support FAQs:
  `docs/faq.md` and `docs/faq.zh-CN.md`.
- Add `ROADMAP.md` with conservative v0.4.x / v0.5 / later boundaries and
  `planned`, `under evaluation`, `runtime verification pending`, and
  `not committed` states.
- Add Documentation & Community navigation in English and Chinese README files and
  FAQ/Guide links in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Record the documentation status updates in `docs/current-state.md` and
  `docs/tasks.md` to keep project-facing state consistent.

## [0.4.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-14

- Add a read-only `npm run doctor` command for macOS, Node.js, Codex,
  provider/model, Keychain-presence, fallback, installation, permissions, and
  local verification prerequisites. It does not mutate configuration, reveal
  credentials or private paths, use the network, or call a paid provider API.
- Add structured GitHub Issue Forms for bugs, provider compatibility requests,
  and feature requests, with explicit sensitive-data and private security
  reporting boundaries.
- Tighten the English and Chinese first-screen onboarding around Codex as the
  main agent, bounded lower-cost delegation, current provider evidence, Doctor,
  and the default dry-run workflow.
- Preserve all existing provider runtime evidence levels; this release does not
  claim new live provider or public-installer verification.

## [0.4.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-08

- Add Qwen3.7-Max as the third reviewed built-in provider pack.
- Verify Alibaba Model Studio Responses, SSE streaming, automatic function
  calls, Codex CLI, Codex Desktop subagent execution, and bridge release.
- Keep the Qwen capability boundary text-only and document that thinking mode
  rejects `tool_choice = "required"` while automatic tool choice works.
- Include `provider-packs.mjs` in the installed runtime so generic preflight can
  resolve the selected provider pack.

## [0.3.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-08

- Add MiniMax-M3 as the second reviewed built-in provider pack.
- Acquire the MiniMax Codex catalog from the official Markdown guide as inert
  text, restrict the installed catalog to text input, and preserve the exact
  case-sensitive API model ID.
- Add provider-specific Keychain auth, a `minimax_worker` agent definition,
  isolated installer tests, and live API/Codex CLI verification records.
- Verify a real Codex Desktop `minimax_worker` task through the owner-only
  compatibility bridge, including successful bridge completion and release.

## [0.2.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-08

- Refactor core flow to provider-pack architecture in `codex-third-party-workers`:
  - generic provider discovery, provider metadata, and runtime path resolution;
  - catalog acquisition/reduction policy decoupled from DeepSeek-specific
    constants;
  - preflight/routing/verifier/install hooks accept provider pack selection with
    backward-compatible `providerSuitable`/`deepseekSuitable` input semantics;
  - runtime bridge and bridge CLI now use shared alias-aware root resolution.
- Require a provider host validator for automatic catalog acquisition and
  validate every destination in a bounded manual redirect chain.
- Publish the generic provider-pack beta with DeepSeek V4 Flash as the first
  built-in pack.

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-06

- Initial unpublished macOS beta implementation.
- Added README disclosures: unofficial project, macOS-only beta, separate
  DeepSeek billing, text/code-only scope, main OpenAI model unchanged,
  dry-run default with explicit `--apply`, and no V4 Pro support.
- Documented runtime model-catalog retrieval from the official DeepSeek setup
  script (never executed) with a local catalog-source override.
- Documented the single-slot DeepSeek task bridge and the policy-assisted
  preflight guardrail (not guaranteed native interception).
- Added dry-run/apply install, local verification, and conflict-safe uninstall
  commands with owner-only backups and a bounded global AGENTS marker.
- Added live Spark/general quota routing, Keychain readiness checks, and safe
  Luna fallback when DeepSeek is unsuitable, unavailable, or bridge-busy.
- Added atomic bridge archives that redact task messages and working paths.
- Added offline fake-home tests for catalog, routing, preflight, install,
  idempotency, verification, uninstall, permissions, and sensitive-data rules.
- Added a read-only GitHub Actions test workflow with no secrets.
